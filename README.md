# HTML CSS Course Project

This is a course on Udemy that I am taking on HTML and CSS. 

I've made some websites before, but have always had a little trouble with items in CSS, and this course was highly reccommended. 


## Update

Due to the age of the course, some of the methods were slightly outdated. I completed the entire course,  but did stop before some of the JQuery Installs which were oddly not working correctly. 

Overall, I learned a lot about CSS during this tutorial
